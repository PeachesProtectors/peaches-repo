# Code Review Notes

## Code Review 1

- Make sure to work with integers when dealing with price. You can do price in pennies and account for the decimal on the frontend
- Protect your routes
- A more efficient schema is to have 4 tables: Products, Orders, OrderProduct(explicitly defined through table), Users, where the relationships are as follows:
    - User has many orders; orders belongs to user
    - Products can be a part of many orders; orders can contain many products
- Remember: You want don't want the price to change in your order history so inside your through table, you should put quantity and price
- Don't put `req.body` directly into `.create` .`update`; destructure it first
- Assigning issues and relating issues to branches in terms of more efficient project management
- Remember gatekeeper functions for your eventual security
- Consider local storage for your guest cart
    - Express sessions work, too
- Do more testing

### Think About This For Our Next Code Review

I asked in our code review:

- What do you think has been the hardest part?
- What do you expect to be the hardest part?

This is what I'll ask in second code review:

- As you went along with the project, what became the hardest part? Did it change from what you originally thought?
